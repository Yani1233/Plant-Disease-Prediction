The main idea of this project is to create a model using CNN to predict the type of disease in tomato plant.
This dataset has 10 labels and a total of 16011 images.
I have splited the dataset into train , test and validation to feed into the model.
Training   - 80% of the data.
Testing    - 10% of the data.
Validation - 10% of the data.
I have rescaled the data and augmented the data  and converted to grey scale to get a good accuracy of the model.
